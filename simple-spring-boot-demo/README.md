# Simple Spring Boot Demo

In this Spring Cloud Stream sample, we will show how multiple functions can be defined in a single application and establish binding to destinations with Solace PubSub+ Broker as the underlying messaging system.

## Requirements

To run this sample, you will need to have installed:

Java 8 or Above

## Code Tour

Spring Cloud Function includes some great features to take composing functions to another level.

Declarative Composition - In our code, we have defined three functions.
```
@Bean
public Function<Message<String>, Message<String>> uppercase() {
    ...
}
@Bean
public Function<Message<String>, Message<String>> reverse() {
    ...
}
@Bean
public Function<Message<String>, Message<String>> lowercase() {
    ...
}
```
We can compose these functions using the spring.cloud.function.definition property `spring.cloud.function.definition=uppercase|reverse|lowercase`

Here | is a composition operator which results in an autoconfigured bean implementing the composite function, along with related resources to let you seamlessly invoke the composite function.

A message received on the `composeFunctionQueue` would be passed through each of the functions and the final result will be published to the topic `caseconversion/topic`



## Running the application

Make sure to update the Solace Broker connection details with appropriate host, msgVpn, client username and password in `spring.cloud.stream.binders.solace-broker.environmet` settings.

```
cd simple-spring-boot-demo
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
This will start the Spring Boot application.

Subscribe to topic `caseconversion/topic` either programmatically or using the Subscriber tool in the `Try Me!` utility of the Solace Broker console.

Publish a message on the topic `composeFunctionQueue` either programmatically or using the Publisher tool in the `Try Me!` utility of the Solace Broker console.

Now, you can see the received message on the topic that contains processed string.

In the terminal, you can see debug messages indicating the invocation of bean functions in sequence.
```
Entering uppercase
uppercase input: Hello world!
uppercase output: HELLO WORLD!
Entering reverse
reverse input: HELLO WORLD!
reverse output: !DLROW OLLEH
Entering lowercase
lowercase input: !DLROW OLLEH
lowercase output: !dlrow olleh
```
